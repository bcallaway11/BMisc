}
\arguments{
\item{y}{a vector to compute the mean for}

\item{weights}{the vector of weights, can be NULL, then will just return mean}

\item{norm}{normalize the weights so that they have mean of 1, default is
to normalize}
}
\value{
the weighted mean
}
\description{
Get the mean applying some weights
