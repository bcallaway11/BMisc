    including functions reprompt() and ereprompt() for updating 'Rd'
    documentation for functions, methods and classes; 'Rd' macros for
    citations and import of references from 'bibtex' files for use in
    'Rd' files and 'roxygen2' comments; 'Rd' macros for evaluating and
    inserting snippets of 'R' code and the results of its evaluation or
    creating graphics on the fly; and many functions for manipulation of
    references and Rd files.
