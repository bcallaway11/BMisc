\title{Data Frame Special Format for Panel Data (Deprecated)}

\description{
  This function was once used to transform a data frame in a format
suitable for using with the estimation functions of \code{plm}.  New
code should rather use the more versatile function
\code{\link{pdata.frame}}.
}

\usage{
plm.data(x, indexes = NULL)
}

\arguments{
 \item{x}{a \code{data.frame},}
 \item{indexes}{a vector (of length one or two) indicating the
  (individual and time) indexes (see Details).}
}

\value{
An object of class \code{c("plm.dim", "data.frame")}.
}

\details{
  This function is kept due to backward compatibility of old code.
  New code should use the function \code{pdata.frame} instead. 

 \code{indexes} can be:

 \itemize{
 \item a character string which is the name of the individual index variable, in this case a new variable called ``time'' containing the time index is added,
 \item an integer, the number of individuals in the case of
  balanced panel, in this case two new variables ``time'' and ``id'' containing the individual and the time indexes are added, 
 \item a vector of two character strings which contains the names of the individual and of the time indexes.
}

\examples{
# There are 595 individuals
data("Wages", package = "plm")
Wages <- plm.data(Wages, 595)

# Gasoline contains two variables which are individual and time indexes
# The pdata.frame is called gas
data("Gasoline", package = "plm")
Gasoline <- plm.data(Gasoline, c("country","year"))
summary(Gasoline)

# Hedonic is an unbalanced panel, townid is the individual index
data("Hedonic", package = "plm")
Hedonic <- plm.data(Hedonic, "townid")
