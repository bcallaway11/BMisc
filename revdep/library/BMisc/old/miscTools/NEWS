THIS IS THE CHANGELOG OF THE "miscTools" PACKAGE

Please note that only the most significant changes are reported here.
A full ChangeLog is available in the log messages of the SVN repository
on R-Forge.


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-22  (2016-11-25)

* function isSemidefinite() is a 'generic' function now, currently with
methods for objects of class 'matrix' and 'list'

* isSemidefinite.matrix() now immediately returns 'FALSE' as soon as a condition
for positive semidefiniteness (or for negative semidefiniteness if argument
'positive' is 'FALSE') is violated, because in this case checking further
conditions is irrelevant

* isSemidefinite.matrix(): the default method for checking semidefiniteness of
matrices with 13 or more rows/coulmns is "eigen" instead of "det" now, because
method "det" can be very slow for larger matrices


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-20  (2016-11-20)

* improved function semidefiniteness() and its documentation

* added function isSemidefinite(), which is currently just an additional
(identical) user interface to semidefiniteness(), but which may replace
semidefiniteness() in the (not so near) future


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-16  (2013-03-13)

* fixed bugs in insertCol() and insertRwo() that occurred when inserting a 
column to a single-row matrix or inserting a row to a single-column matrix
(bug reported and solution provided by Max Gordon -- Thanks a lot!)


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-14  (2012-12-26)

* corrected bug in compPlot(): the 45-degree-line was not always drawn if the
axes had logarithmic scales

* compPlot() now uses informative labels of the axes by labelling the axes
with the expressions that are used for specifying the objects in the call 
(before, the axes were always labelled by "x" and "y", respectively)


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-12  (2011-11-12)

* added generic function margEff() 


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-10  (2010-10-15)

* stdEr.default() now checks for x$std only if x is an object of S3 class


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-8  (2010-09-02)

* moved generic function stdEr() including a default method and a method
for objects of class "lm" from the "maxLik" package to this package


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-6

* added generic functions nObs() and nParam() including the "default" methods
and methods for objects of class "lm"; these generic functions and their methods
were moved from the "maxLik" package to this package

* added function ddnorm(), which calculates the derivative(s) of the density
function of the normal (Gaussian) distribution with respect to the quantile

* added function sumKeepAttr() that returns the sum of an array while keeping
its attributes


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-2

* added function "logDataSet", which was formerly part of the "micEcon" package,
  where it had the name ".micEconLogData"

* function "colMedians" can return the medians of each non-row
  of an *array* now
