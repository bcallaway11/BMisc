abstract: These are miscellaneous functions for working with panel data, quantiles,
  and printing results. For panel data, the package includes functions for making
  a panel data balanced (that is, dropping missing individuals that have missing observations
  in any time period), converting id numbers to row numbers, and to treat repeated
  cross sections as panel data under the assumption of rank invariance. For quantiles,
  there are functions to make distribution functions from a set of data points (this
  is particularly useful when a distribution function is created in several steps),
  to combine distribution functions based on some external weights, and to invert
  distribution functions. Finally, there are several other miscellaneous functions
  for obtaining weighted means, weighted distribution functions, and weighted quantiles;
  to generate summary statistics and their differences for two groups; and to add
  or drop covariates from formulas.
